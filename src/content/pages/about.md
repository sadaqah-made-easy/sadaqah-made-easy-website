We are an independent platform dedicated to showcasing authentic and transparent donation projects of all types. We do not collect money (sadaqah) nor are we affiliated with any organization, party, or group. Our mission is to provide a space where people can discover trustworthy donation opportunities that align with their values, and contribute to causes that matter to them.
